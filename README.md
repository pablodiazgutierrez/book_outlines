# Book outlines
This project is a simple collection of book outilnes as I read them, for reflection and recollection.

## In progress

* Coders at Work, by Peter Seibel
* [Traction, by Gabriel Weinberg](outlines/traction.md)
* The Making of the Atomic Bomb, by Richard Rhodes

## Finished
None so far.
