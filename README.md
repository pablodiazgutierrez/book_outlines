# Book outlines
This project is a simple collection of book outlines as I read them, for better assimilation and future recollection. Someone made the argument that by writing about what you just read, you improve retention and get more out of it. Besides that, it would be nice to come back and re-learn what I just read, long past the time when I can remember them. I imagine this exercise makes more sense with non-fiction books, which coincidentally is what I enjoy reading the most.

## Books I haven't finished reading
* Learn you a Haskell for Great Good, by Miran Lipovaca
* [Coders at Work, by Peter Seibel](outlines/coders.md)

## Books I finished, or stopped reading for any reason
None since I started this exercise.
